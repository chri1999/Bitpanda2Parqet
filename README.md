# Bitpanda2Parqet
Load Data from Bitpanda Api and make it uploadable for Parqet

This Tool is used to upload your Bitpanda Transactions directly to Parqet or export a .csv file from your Bitpanda API. The created .csv can then be uploaded to Parqet.
Notice: As I personally only have buy orders, the program will not get everything right and you should double check in Parqet. Please let me know if there is any data loaded wrong in Parqet.

# Parameters and Description

You have to enter some Parameters into the tool. The Bitpanda API is always necessary, you will get it from your Bitpanda Account.

The Parqet Token is availibe with the developer Tools of your Browser when opening Parqet.
